# JavaCamp
solutions to final projects

Dear Students, 

Thank you for coming to my Java class at Foothill this week. You were a wonderful class, and the TAs and I really enjoyed your great questions and enthusiasm! 

I've posted here the solutions to the final "projects" we did on the last day. The solutions are in files that end with ".java". I also posted the descriptions of the projects. For the receipt project, I added an explanation for each step as well. 

In case you would like to continue working on these projects or practicing other projects on your own, you will need: 

1. Java. Remember how we learned about the Java Virtual Machine? You can download the package needed to compile and run your Java code at: http://java.com/download/      Note: it will automatically detect what your operating system is an have you download the right version. 

2. An editor. We used Eclipse in our class, which you can get at: http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/eclipse-ide-java-ee-developers/marsr
Note that this is the current version for Eclipse, but on the left side of this page, you can see all the versions and choose any of them. The newest one is still sometimes being tested, so it can be good to select the second newest. Eclipse versions have a names that start with letters in order of the alphabet, so that you can see which versions are older vs. newer. For example, after Luna (L) came Mars (M) and then Neon (N). If you plan to try out the Tortoise, see below.

Also note that these downloads are both free! 

Some people also asked about the materials we used in this class. 

1. For the Tortoise, we used "Teaching Kids Programming": http://teachingkidsprogramming.org/courses/
We used some, but not all, material in lessons 1-3. NOTE: if you want to try this on your own, you will need to use the "Luna" version of Eclipse. This may change, so if you look at this at a later point, check the download instructions first. There are download instructions at:
https://github.com/TeachingKidsProgramming/TeachingKidsProgramming.Java/blob/master/README.md

2. Some of the lecture slides were from MIT Open Courseware: http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-092-introduction-to-programming-in-java-january-iap-2010/lecture-notes/

3. For those interested in object-oriented programming, here is a link to a good lecture from a professor at the University of Virginia: https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~asb/teaching/cs101-spring07/lectures/101/08-ch6-classes.ppt

Best of luck with whatever route you explore in computer science. Remember to have confidence and keep learning!
