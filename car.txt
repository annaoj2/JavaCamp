Make a new "CarTest" class - make sure to check the option for a main function!!!

Build a Car class with the following attributes: 
fuel (int)
color (String)
x (int - x position)
y (int - y position)

Make two constructors: 
1. default constructor
2. constructor that sets all car attributes

As you go, build accessors for attributes as necessary. 

Build a print function that will print all the current attributes of the car. 

Add functionality to move the car. It will require 1 unit of fuel per one unit of change in x or y. Remember that you must ensure you have enough fuel before moving. 

Add functionality to fuel up the car. 

Now add a variable to your class to represent total money spent on the car. When you add fuel, it will cost $2.93/gallon.
